# 🎯 JS Mini Practice Project

This repository contains small JavaScript DOM "warmup" projects to sharpen core event handling, animation, and interaction skills.

## 🔸 Project 1: Color Change on Mouse Movement

**Objective:**  
Create a rectangle that responds to mouse movement:
- When the mouse moves toward the **left side**, the rectangle **gradually changes to red**.
- When the mouse moves toward the **right side**, the rectangle **gradually changes to blue**.

**Goal:**  
Smoothly interpolate the background color based on mouse position.

## 🔸 Project 2: Slow Down Rectangle Based on Mouse Direction

**Objective:**  
Create a rectangle whose **movement speed decreases**:
- As the mouse moves **closer to the left**, the rectangle slows down proportionally.
- As the mouse moves **closer to the right**, the same behavior occurs.

**Goal:**  
Practice animation timing control using mouse coordinates.

## 🔸 Project 3: Hover-to-Reveal Image Popup

**Objective:**  
- Create a `div` that shows an image **when the mouse hovers over it**.
- The image should **appear ("pop up")** and then **disappear** once the mouse leaves.

**Goal:**  
Build interaction using `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` events, and animate appearance/disappearance of elements.
